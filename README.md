#### Data Structure, algorithm, and unit test of course

## Introduction

Anyone are welcome to use, critisize the source code. If you find bugs and are not satisfied with the code, please file a issue, since the repository is created to improve my not-so-good programming skills.

## What are included:

 It includes a collection of source codes from books I read, and some solutions to the quizes from those books.

 - List:  DList.h. [Aus99], [Sed98]. Bidirectional List with Iterator.
 - Orbit: Orbit.h. [Step09], Elements of Programming. Transformation is a regular function from a type to itself. Starting from a init, application of the transformation again and again forms an orbit.
